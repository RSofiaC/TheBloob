Board
	Arduino Genuino Micro
	Communication ?The 32U4 provides UART TTL (5V) serial 
communication, which is available on digital pins 0 (RX) and 1 (TX). 
The ATmega32U4 also allows for serial (CDC) communication over 
USB and appears as a virtual com port to software on the computer. 
The chip also acts as a full speed USB 2.0 device, using standard 
USB COM drivers. On Windows, a .inf file is required . The Arduino 
Software (IDE) includes a serial monitor which allows simple textual 
data to be sent to and from the board. The RX and TX LEDs on the 
board will flash when data is being transmitted via the USB 
connection to the computer (but not for serial communication on pins 
0 and 1).
A SoftwareSerial library allows for serial communication on other 
Micro's digital pins.
The ATmega32U4 also supports I2C (TWI) and SPI communication. 
The Arduino Software (IDE) includes a Wire library to simplify use of 
the I2C bus; see the documentation for details. For SPI 
communication, use the SPI library.
The Micro appears as a generic keyboard and mouse, and can be 
programmed to control these input devices using the Keyboard and 
Mouse classes.?
